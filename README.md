# ToyhouseDatabase
This is the official repository of our database class project 2012.
# Declaration
1. `htdocs` directory contains all the base code we use in our project namely `elgg`, `mediawiki`, `question2answer`, `phprojekt`
. They are deployed on `toyhouse.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn` and can run. So, any time you push files to this repo, you should ensure
code run well on the server. In a word, it should be fully tested before uploaded.
2. `docs` directory contains all the docuemnts from the 9 teams. They maybe `api` document or something else.
3. `database` directory contains newest database of our project.
4. Upload you databse each time you upload your code.

# Notes
Please make sure that you upgrade your local repo before you modify code or docs. Or you maybe have to face the conflict problem
which is nightmare I promise.
